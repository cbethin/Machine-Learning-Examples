# Machine-Learning-Examples
Just some sample code of my playing around with applications of machine learning

**Experimental** and **Data_Analysis** both deal with simple implementations of Reccurent Neural Networks and their potential applications in bandwidth estimation on Home WiFi networks as well as in their usage as autoencoders to classify video networking streams. Currently, neither show successful results, but further engineering of features should be done to identify the full prospects of using RNNs in identifying and predicting network content. (Note only one of the datasets have been provided due to size)
